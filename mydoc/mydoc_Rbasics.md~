## General Overview
[R](http://cran.at.r-project.org) is a comprehensive statistical environment
and programming language for professional data analysis and graphical display.
The associated [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) project provides many additional R packages for
statistical data analysis in different life science areas, such as tools for
microarray, next generation sequence and genome analysis. The R software is
free and runs on all common operating systems. 

## Scope of this Manual
This tutorial provides a condensed introduction into the usage of the R
environment and its utilities for general data analysis and clustering. It also
introduces a subset of packages from the
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) project. The included packages are a
*personal selection* of the author of this manual that does not reflect the
full utility specturm of the R/Bioconductor projects. Many packages were
chosen, because the author uses them often for his own teaching and research.
To obtain a broad overview of available R packages, it is strongly recommended
to consult the official Bioconductor and R project sites. Due to the rapid
development of most packages, it is also important to be aware that this manual
will often not be fully up-to-date. Because of this and many other reasons, it
is absolutely critical to use the original documentation of each package (PDF
manual or vignette) as primary source of documentation. Users are welcome to
send suggestions for improving this manual directly to its
[author](mailto:tgirke@citrus.ucr.edu).

## Format of this Manual
A not always very easy to read, but practical *copy & paste* format has been
chosen throughout this manual. In this format all commands are represented in
code boxes, where the comments are given in blue color. To save space, often
several commands are concatenated on one line and separated with a semicolon
`;`. All comments/explanations start with the standard comment sign `#` to
prevent them from being interpreted by R as commands. This way several commands
can be pasted with their comment text into the R console to demo the different
functions and analysis steps. Commands starting with a `$` sign need to be
executed from a Unix or Linux shell. Windows users can simply ignore them.
Commands highlighted in red color are considered essential knowledge. They are
important for someone interested in a quick start with R and Bioconductor.
Where relevant, the output generated by R is given in green color. 

## Installation of the R Software and R Packages
The installation instructions are provided in the 
[Administrative Section](http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/R_BioCondManual#TOC-Administration) 
of this manual. R working environments with syntax highlighting support and
utilities to send code to the R console: 

* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/features): excellent choice for beginners ([Cheat Sheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf)) 
* Basic R code editors provided by Rguis 
* [gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit), [Rgedit](http://rgedit.sourceforge.net/), [RKWard](https://rkward.kde.org/), [Eclipse](http://www.walware.de/goto/statet), [Tinn-R](http://www.sciviews.org/Tinn-R/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [NppToR](http://sourceforge.net/projects/npptor/)
* [Vim-R-Tmux](http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/programming-in-r/vim-r): R working environment based on vim and tmux 
* [Emacs](http://www.xemacs.org/Download/index.html) ([ESS add-on package](http://ess.r-project.org/))
